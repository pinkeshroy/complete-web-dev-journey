Task: Create a React Note-taking App
   1. Create a React application that allows users to manage notes. Each note should have a title and a description.
   2. Implement a form that allows users to add new notes. The form should include input fields for the title and description of the note.
   3. When a new note is added, it should appear at the top of the list of notes.
   4. Each note in the list should have options to edit and delete it. Clicking the "Edit" option should open a modal or a separate form where users can edit the note's title and description. Clicking the "Delete" option should remove the note from the list.
   5. Implement local storage functionality to store and retrieve notes data. When the application loads, it should check local storage for existing notes and display them on the screen. When a new note is added, edited, or deleted, the local storage should be updated accordingly.
