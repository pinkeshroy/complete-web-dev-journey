Optimize performance and memory usage Integrate a Lorem Ipsum generator, together with some intuitive syntax for specifying parameters of the text you want generated (length in chars or words, casing, etc) Ability to call and define image crops from within CSS (i.e. ability to post image requests in the URL to dummy.php) Develop an easy way to link our broadcast dumb_luck outcomes, so that one outcome could bubble-over to another. Clean up the way errors and messages are formatted (i.e. abstract the HTML and inline styles that surround them) The image assets that ship with Dummy are highly geared for usage in editorial design. One could imagine separate asset packages for different types of projects (e.g. a commerce package with commercial product shots, a portfolio or gallery package with images that showcase art, architecture, or design).
